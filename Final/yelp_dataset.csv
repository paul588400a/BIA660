When you walk out the front door Scott Monument and Princes street are right in front of you, Edinburgh Castle and the Royal Mile is a 2 minute walk via a close right around the corner, and there are so many hidden gems nearby including Calton Hill and the newly opened Arches that made this location incredible.

The hotel itself was also very nice with a reasonably priced bar, very considerate staff, and small but comfortable rooms with excellent bathrooms and showers. Only two minor complaints are no telephones in room for room service (not a huge deal for us) and no AC in the room, but they have huge windows which can be fully opened. The staff were incredible though, letting us borrow umbrellas for the rain, giving us maps and directions, and also when we had lost our only UK adapter for charging our phones gave us a very fancy one for free.

I would highly recommend this hotel to friends, and when I return to Edinburgh (which I most definitely will) I will be staying here without any hesitation.",uYHaNptLzDLoV_JZ_MuzUA,5,2016/7/12,0,0

Pros:
Great location- you're right by the train station, central location to get to old town and new town, and right by sight seeing his tours. Food, bars, and shopping all within walking distance. Location, location, location.
Very clean and very good maid service

Cons:
Tiny rooms 
Uncomfortable bed 
Absolutely no amenities 
No phone in room 
No wardrobe 

Was given a lot of attitude about me and my husband sharing a room which was quite strange and we were charged 15 pounds more for double occupancy not sure why that matters I felt like it was a money grab. It was just handled in a kind of odd manner to me...

0,AXgRULmWcME7J6Ix3I--ww,ne5WhI1jUFOcRn-b-gAzHA,"Mittlerweile gibt es in Edinburgh zwei Ableger der Motel-One-Kette - diese hier ist eher das schlechtere.

Wir hatten auf unserer Schottlandtour die Gelegenheit beide Ableger kennenzulernen, da wir beide Nòchte in Edinburgh (am ersten sowie am letzten Tag) in einem der beiden Motel One's verbrachten. Von diesem hier waren wir nach dem 	berraschend positiven Erlebnis im Motel One an der Princes Street [1] etwas enttòuscht.

Das Hotel ist wesentlich gršer und extrem un	bersichtlich. Da man auf der f	nften Etage noch Teile eines weiteren Gebòude, das mittels einer Glasbr	cke mit dem Hauptgebòude verbunden ist, hinzugenommen hat, kann die Suche nach dem Zimmer insbesondere auf dieser Etage zu einem Gang im Labyrinth ausarten. Habe ich so noch in keinem Hotel erlebt - uns begegneten immer wieder Menschen, die sich auf der Suche nach ihren Zimmern verirrt haben.
Unser Zimmer war òhnlich aufgebaut wie das Zimmer im Motel One Princes Street - befand sich jedoch im Inneren des Gebòudes und hatte daher kein Fenster. Nur eine kleine Dachluke, die sich am oberen Ende eines etwa 3m langen Schachts befand, sorgte f	r einen minimalen Anteil Tageslicht im Zimmer. diese Luke lie sich auch nicht šffnen, nur ein elektrisches Rolches Rollo lie sich mittels eines Schalters šffnen bzw. schlieen.
Sonst gilt f	r das Zimmer eigentlich das Gleiche wie f	r das Zimmer im im Motel One Princes Street: Relativ klein, trotzdem extrem ansprechend und schick gestaltet und clever durchdacht. Dazu sehr ruhig.

Im gesamten Hotel gibt es kostenloses WLAN f	r die Dauer des Aufenthalts f	r maximal 3 Geròte.

Die Lage des Motel One Royal Mile ist groartig. Vom Airlink-Flughafenbus kann man quasi in den Hoteleingang stolpern, es sind maximal 50m. Zur Royal Mile sind es etwa 100m Luftlinie (bergauf) und man benštigt etwa 5 Minuten bis dort.

Das Fr	hst	ck f	r 9,50 GBP / Person kann man nutzen - muss man aber nicht. Es ist eher 	bersichtlich und kontinetaler Prògung, trotzdem aber sehr gut. F	r den gleichen Preis oder weniger bekommt man aber problemlos ein reichhaltiges Fr	hst	ck in einem der zahlreichen Cafes von Edinburgh.

F	r ein oder zwei Nòchte kann man hier problemlos bleiben, sollte aber nicht allzuviel erwarten. Hat man die Wahl, sollte man meiner Erfahrung nach lieber auf das andere Motel otel One an der Princes Street ausweichen.

They are very helpful and have a lot of patience answering all my questions about where to go etc. there is also a lounge open 24 hours with snack-type food. Breakfast is continental-style so if you want heartier fare look elsewhere though you don't have to go far. The bus and train stations are right across the street so it's easy access to the airport or anywhere else you may want to go. Turn uphill to old town or cross the bridge to new town. The room with a view i got was spacious and comfortable though it's a bit of a maze to find it-just follow the signs. The windows are double paned so the room is quiet plus i was on the 5th floor which helps. It's a bit pricey but still one of the best values i found!,uYHaNptLzDLoV_JZ_MuzUA,4,2016/8/21,0,0

Firstly they don't have any twin rooms in the hotel which would be preferable when I was sharing with a friend not my lover! There is only one small bin which is located in the bathroom.  No soap, which I find ridiculous, only toiletries were a dual shower gel/hair wash. There was a hairdryer but no wardrobes or drawers. Room was also very cold. 

Now for the positive, the location is very good, close to princes street and St. Andrews square. The staff are very helpful and the bar is 24 hours. 

Don't bother with the breakfast which is Â£9.50 each for a continental breakfast where you can easily get a cooked breakfast in any one of the cafes in Cockburn Street, which is adjacent to this hotel.

Motel One is, as the name suggests, aimed at the budget market. Rates for this venue range from approximately â69/night up. I booked ahead and appreciated the completely free reservation process with room guaranteed until 6pm on the day of arrival. If you give your credit card details, it's reserved beyond that time.

Location is excellent! If you exit from the Market St side of Waverly and turn right it's maybe 3 minutes away. It would be very hard to have it closer. That also makes it very close to the castle and Princes St. Welcome was warm and check-in easy. The lobby area is pretty small but clean and cosy with sweets, maps etc. There's a bar area down a few steps where they also serve the buffet breakfast each morning.

My room was the cheapest version and was internal, facing onto a courtyard. It had no view and was quite dark, but quiet. Everything was completely spotless. The bathroom was small but well designed and had a great shower. Bed was comfy with 2 single duvets. So continental, don't you know? I appreciated the tea and coffee making facilities (I'm like a beast without them), the decent sized TV andd the free wifi. The hanging storage facilities are limited but it was fine for a few days. 

Random: hands down the best hotel hairdryer I have ever used. And one of the best dryers in general-called a Black Mambo. It was worth staying there for that alone.

We did pay a premium over the normal rate but given the crowds in the city during this time, it was still a good deal compared to other hotels.

Staff were all friendly and welcoming, presentable and professional.
We received a room upgrade with quite a large room overlooking the bridge crossing Waverley station to Princes St. Despite overlooking a busy road, the room was almost silent thanks to solid double glazing. The room temperature was perfectly controlled with an individual A/C unit. Super clean, modern, uncluttered. Bathroom was similar. No slamming doors or noise in the night. Bonus.

Free wifi that works with one log in (doesn't require repeated log ins as some places do) and had decent signal strength.

The buffet continental breakfast was also a hit with fresh croissants, danishes, cold cuts, cheese, toast, fruit and yoghurt all well presented, fresh and good quality as was the coffee.

On entry it's modern, cosy has tons of cool yet bright pastel and mochilato colours to accommodate your cold wintertime self. Wooden floors, warm rugs, sheepskins on the sofas, slate walls and oak barrelled tables, with slight distinct Scottish themes due to their tartan furnished accessories completes the feel.

I sat in One Lounge, had tea and food self served for well under Â£10, you know bran, meats cheese and croissant that sort of stuff. With a copy of local newspaper in hand I really needed to eat, stay warm and access wifi, the reasons I came in.

Some hotels in the city give you access to wifi if your a paying guest, but repeated attempts to access their wifi even with staff help, eventually gave access but in German. On going to reception again for additional help the staff were great got the correct website for me, but still no luck.

Hmmm, by the time this was all done I came back to cold tea and didn't really have time now to finish a second cup of hot Earl Grey, so sorry to staff for removing an almost full cup of tea.

With that said I've always had pretty good experiences with Pei Wei, the food although not spectacular is better than some of the overcooked chicken drowning in MSG offered by some of the local chinese restaurants.  the portions are good sized, the food is generally consistent, and the prices are really reasonable considering this is a corporate chain in some cases cheaper than the local establishments. or dare I say it's name ""panda express"" (which is overpriced crap)

the time before last that I went they forgot the tomato's and the dressing for an asian chopped chicken salad that my wife ordered, I didn't discover that the dressing was missing until I got home, I immediately called the restaurant and was speaking to a manager within 30 seconds. The manager apologized and asked me If I would like to come back to the restaurant or if he could have my address so he could send me a gift certificate. I decided to go back to the restaurant, when I got the restaurant I told the person at the counter my name and they already had a bag set aside for me, the manager came over and explained to me there was another full salad in the bag, and he put additional dressing for the salad we already had, and additionally he gave me a coupon for free lettuce wraps.(which mental note: I need to use)

I must say I was impressed with this manager, and it was refreshing after being in situations where a manager has taken back the bag/plate and essentially ""un-F$@k's"" your food and returns it to you.

My shrimp was thickly coated in an overpowering  sauce as well.  I only ate some of the veggies that take center stage on a meat dish.  The center of my pork egg roll was cold. The hot N sour soup was a much thicker consistency almost like that of a chili instead of being brothy. Worst of all was the price.  This was not worth it to us.

We discovered the Surprise location a couple weeks ago and decided that tonight we would grab a quick bite. The hubs ordered Mongolian Beef (his fav at PF Chang's) and I ordered my ""tried and true"" Ginger Broccoli and Chicken."" Of course we started with the Lettuce Wraps because honestly...they are just the most delicious things ever!

Tonight we were pleasantly suprised that the food was quite delicious. Although the dishes are EXACTLY like what you would get at PF Chang's they are scrumptous in their own right. The only downfall is that the noise isn't conducive to conversation.  I haven't been to an establishment this noisy since Buca de Beppo's...which I love (don't get me wrong)!  But I will say (on a positive note) that the customer service is fabulous! Something that can be hard to come by at times...

As for price....$28 bucks for the two of us including an appetizer, two entrees and two drinks. (coke and iced tea...with free refills) Seems a bit pricy to me but honestly....EVERYTHING is expensive now days. 

Overall, try it out...they offer take out too so you can enjoy great food in the comfort of your home....without all the noise! (or they have a patio you can dine from)",jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ,4,2008/10/6,0,0

I placed my order online.  Easy process.  My wife went with an order of Chicken Lo Mein and I went with Sesame Chicken/Steak with fried rice as well as an egg roll and 2 pot stickers.  Total for everything was $24.80 after tax.  I drove down and picked up my food.  The manager their was friendly, rang me up real quick and I was out the door in no time. This bag was heavy as hell too!   Here is how everything tasted.....................

Chicken Lo Mein-  Only had a little of this.  Good noodles, good white meat chicken.  My wife liked it.

Sesame Chicken/Steak-  I decided to try out 2 kinds of meat.  They let you mix and match which is cool...they charge you for the highest priced item.  I substituted fried rice for white rice (.99 cents extra).  This was touted as soy citrus glaze, red bell peppers, onions, scallions, ginger, garlic and chile paste and sesame seeds.  It was just alright.  The flavors didn't really do much for me.  It was a tad spicy from the chile paste but overall it was kind of bland.  I had some pieces of steak/chicken that were a bit funky too.  I would definitely try out a different dish next time here...if there is a next time ;-).  The fried rice was good!

Egg Roll- Eh.  It was an egg roll.  Nothing fantastic about it but it tasted fine.  It came with a sweet mustard dipping sauce which was pretty tasty.  Usual fillings of pork, veggies etc.

Deep Fried Pot Stickers-  I got 2 of these things.  They were good.  Small but good.  Straight pork filling in the middle of them.  

Overall it was just alright.  I will say that they give you a GRIP of food.  The 2 entrees we got could have easily fed 1-2 more people.  For $24.80 it was a great value.  The food just wasn't the type of thing that  you would ever crave and keep you coming back though.  While I was eating my meal, all I could think of were better Chinese food places I have had before....wishing I was eating them instead.  It filled my belly, service was friendly and the value is definitely there.  I'll probably give them another try and order some other dishes to see if there is something I really like.

Honey crusted chicken also quite good, same story with the rice.  Same thing with the sweet and sour beef.

Ordered the Pad Thai without peanuts... Son is allergic to peanuts so we made it very clear we didn't want anything with nuts.  They deliver the pad Thai with peanuts all over the top.  Sent it back and they fixed it.

They brought us spring rolls which we did not order.  We said they were not ours we ordered wontons.  They bring us the wontons a few minutes later.

0,F783ardridpj3owUMHg-Fg,wFP3lpVdl03_NxZoXL4Pzg,"The wait time for the food was way too long- 30 minutes for a bowl of spicy noodles with some veggies. I'm a guest from out of state but this is nothing better than my local Panda joint. They should probably let the customers cook the food cause we could do it faster. 
The food was okay but the portions were a bit big. While I was waiting for the food (+30 min) I noticed a lot of people just ate a few bites and left the food on the table. So much food wasted- there must be a reason for that right?? 
The bathrooms weren't clean, barely had soap no towels and toilet didn't even flush!! 
I hope next time I'm down here that it isn't this bad.",jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ,2,2015/11/7,0,0

Only two tables were occupied at the time we walked in for a carry out. We walked in and they looked at us like.....really? Go away!! Someone walked up to the register and he just looked at me. I asked him if he was ready to take my order and he just kept looking at me like I was wasting his time.  No thank you, nothing. Just a hand to take my money and then a bag in my face so I would leave and get out of their faces. Really???",jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ,1,2014/10/27,0,0
0,kq0emTsKE2DcDOWbe1NYRg,M6qZU16SjXoyoLrmNENhQg,We are from the Midwest and are visiting Phoenix on a vacation. We stopped in this place for some quick Asian food. What a great surprise! I had the Mongolian chicken and it was great. Very similar to PF Chang. You order at the counter and they bring the food. I wish we had one of these where I live.,jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ,5,2017/3/6,0,0

First I was unable to order online,   when I  went to pick up the food I brought  a gift card with a remaining credit on it and the remaining total written on top with a permanent marker which would have covered the entire cost of my meal. When I handed it over to the employee  she swiped the card and simply stated there is a zero balance on this card. To which I replied that can't be correct because the last time I used it the employee wrote the available balance on the top of the card for me. The cashier didn't seem to take me serious and simply asked for another method of payment. I was in a rush it was my lunch hour so  I paid out of pocket. 
The sauce on my food taste watered down over all a poor experience. To add insult to injury I later called the number on my gift card and they assured me that I did have a credit balance which leave's me wondering what are gift card's good for?

Service is always good here and on par with other top places in Mentor. I really suggest the chicken soup on a cold day it's very yummy!

Service was friendly and fast, food was excellent, and they have DRAFT BEER, including a couple of Mexican brews.

0,BYgAy3hu2s5GeiJ5WMuD0w,O5UfgCBj4osaEeolc_muUA,"Kind of disappointed with the previous reviews in the area of customer service because honestly there was none. We were the only patrons in the restaurant and the waiter seemed  inconvenienced by us being there. After he took our order he went and sat down in another booth and started playing on a computer. We did not get our food quickly like everyone else has said, as we were the only people here it shouldn't take as long as it takes for me to finish my beverage. Maybe it had something to do with the fact that the waiter was farting around instead of doing his job? They got three stars because despite the service the food was AMAZING and quite inexpensive. If you order a quesadilla you may want to order a la carte items as well because the quesadilla was the size of a large Taco which is odd.",dwQEZBFen2GdihLLfWeexA,3,2011/6/14,0,0
