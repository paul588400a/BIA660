606,We were the only patrons in the restaurant and the waiter seemed  inconvenienced by us being there.,,
607,After he took our order he went and sat down in another booth and started playing on a computer.,,
608,"We did not get our food quickly like everyone else has said, as we were the only people here it shouldn't take as long as it takes for me to finish my beverage.",,
609,Maybe it had something to do with the fact that the waiter was farting around instead of doing his job?,,
610,They got three stars because despite the service the food was AMAZING and quite inexpensive.,,
611,If you order a quesadilla you may want to order a la carte items as well because the quesadilla was the size of a large Taco which is odd.,,
612,"I eat here all the time and most of the staff are from Guadalajara.... Food is definately ""americanized"" and by that i mean tamed down in heat and changed a little for what americans expect....",,
613,But when i order my racos de carne asada with lime and cilantro and onions.... All i get are big smiles and HOT sauce....,,
